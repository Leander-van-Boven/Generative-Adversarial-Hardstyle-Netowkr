# Generative Adversarial Hardstyle Network (Hardstyle-GAN)

This project tries to train a Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) on music of various artists within the Hardstyle genre. 

## Goals
Because of its novelty, the first aim will be to create a generative and adversarial network capable of producing music that resembles hardstyle.

Because each hardstyle artist has their unique sound, the second goal will be to try to train a model capable of producing hardstyle music tailored to a specific artist.

If all of the above turn out successful, finally some attempts will be made to make a general model for all artists but you are able to bias the generation towards certain artist(s).
